# Curated List of Machine Learning Resources

A curated list of machine Learning resource I find very useful. The List is structured into the following topics:

- **Programming** - resources to get started with the most used programming languages in machine learning.
- **Mathematics** - great resource to get the mathematical foundation you need for machine learning.
- **Statistics** - the statistics basic you should know.
- **Machine Learning** - a lot of interesting resources with focus on machine learning, deep learning and data science.
- **Data Visualization** - collection of resource which teaches you to visualize your results.
